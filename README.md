## Abstract

It is recommended that teacher-scholars of data science adopt reproducible workflows in their research as scholars and teach reproducible workflows to their students. This talk, which is based on our paper with the same title, proposes a third dimension to reproducibility practices and recommends that regardless of whether they teach reproducibility in their courses or not, data science instructors adopt reproducible workflows for their own teaching. The talk dives into tools, examples, and recommendations for each of the three pillars (computational reproducibility, documentation, and openness) and shares our experiences with using these recommendations in our own teaching.
